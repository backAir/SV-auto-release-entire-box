# Box release

This script will release an entire box in Pokémon Scarlet/Violet.

#### How to use

- Download Joystick.hex
- Download the [Teensy Loader application](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/loader.html) and inject Joystick.hex with the included instructions
- SAVE YOUR GAME and then disable auto save (I don't want to be responsible for accidentally releasing any valuable pokemon)
- Go to a full box that you want to release
- Put your cursor on the first Pokémon in your party
- Disconnect all controllers
- Plug in the Teensy board
- The board will stop by itself after clearing all boxes.
